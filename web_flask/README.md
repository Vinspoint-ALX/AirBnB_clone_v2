ALXBnB is a student project that aims to build a clone of the AirBnB website. The initial stage of the project is to implement a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. The console allows users to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Storage is persistent between sessions using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization.

The project is currently only in the development stage and only the backend console has been implemented. The front-end interface and database storage are still under development.
